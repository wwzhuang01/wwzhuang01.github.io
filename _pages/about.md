Hi! I’m Wenwen Zhuang, a second-year master’s student at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Prior to this, I received my bachelor’s degree in computer science from Central South University in June 2023. Previously, I was a research intern at Microsoft Research Asia and ByteDance. My current research interests include natural language processing and multimodal large language models, with a particular focus on reasoning in MLLMs.
